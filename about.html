    <p>Hey!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Olivia and my goal is to introduce you to...yourself! <br />I focus on helping you to hear your own
         voice and get connected to yourself on a deeper level using dreams as our entrance point to help you meet the parts of yourself you've been missing.</p>
         <p>My work centers around the belief that one of our biggest needs as human beings is to be seen and heard as our truest selves. We want to be visible. We want someone to know we are here. 
             And one of the most powerful things you can do is learn how to fully see and hear yourself. My goal is to help you do that!
            </p>
