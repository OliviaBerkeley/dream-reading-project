<h2 class="lh-lg mb-4 h2-special d-block d-md-none">You have the guide you need within you. The key is your
    dreams. Let me unlock the door for you through dream readings.</h2>
  <p class="mb-5 description text-muted">So what exactly is a dream reading? When I do a reading, I tune in intuitively—as well as building on extensive experience with different traditions
surrounding symbolism—in order to interpret your dream. Your dreams provide you information. If you've been feeling a bit lost, uncertain, or just off-kilter, I use your dreams to give you insight into that.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-3">The Process</h3>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">You have a dream. I have a Google form. When you book a reading, you get to tell me all about your dream on that
                form.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">I'll review your dream before I confirm a reading. Once I've confirmed the reading, we'll handle all the
                practicalities like payment and how and when you'll receive your report.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-3">The Report</h3>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">The information I give you in a dream reading is very detailed and extensive. I go
                through each layer of the dream,
                address individual components, and also give you the low down on how it all ties together.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">I put it all into a report that will be sent to you as a PDF. This way you can take
                your time to really look it over.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-3">Zoom Session</h3>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">After I've done a reading, I've had clients who have wanted a session for us to talk and go over the dream reading so we could dive in even deeper. </p>
            <p class="text-muted">If that's something that you feel would be helpful to you, I now offer 30-minute or 60-minute sessions via Zoom where we can talk about questions you have and talk through what has come up for you after the reading.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-3">Just so you know...</h3>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">I get a lot of information when I do a reading. One of the most frequent reactions I get is, "You know too much!"</p>
            <p class="text-muted">So if you have a secret identity as like, a vigilante or Hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village or something, just keep
                that in mind.</p>

    <h3 class="mb-4 mt-5">Let's do a little experiment!</h3>
    <p class="mb-5">Envision all your restrictions and judgments as a bag that you’ve been carrying, and set it down.<br /><br />
        Think of all the adjectives and titles you’d use to describe yourself, and set them down. Imagine setting down what your
        family expects of you. Imagine setting down your own rules for what you’re allowed to do and who you’re allowed to be.
        Imagine setting down the weight of judgment from others.<br /> <br /> You can pick all of this back up after this experiment if you wish. But
        for now, just imagine who you would be if all of those things were removed. Take a few moments to really immerse yourself in how it would feel to have all of these things removed.
        <br /> <br />This is the "you" that we can tap into through your dreams. Know that you've had the power all along — you have the strength, you have the knowledge, you have the courage. We just need to tap into it!</p>
